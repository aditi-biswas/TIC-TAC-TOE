# TIC-TAC-TOE
A 2-player game using python

Who doesn't like a tic-tac-toe game? Here's a tic-tac-toe game to freshen up your minds after a tiring hectic day. The 1st player is asked for what sign he wants to mark and the 2nd player is automatically assigned the other sign. Players have to enter the position where they want to mark. The tic-tac-toe board is printed after each player's chance. Hope you have a good experience.
